1.spell checking can only do replace, not delete, insertion, transpose;
2.when doing the spell checking, i removede the stop words building the vocabulary. To prevent
the high frequncy words pollute the result. However, this trade off shows defect when query is natural 
language like ' how do i hack the internet', in this case, how, do, the, will be "corrected" to some strange
word with far from the user intention. Since the search side have no way to know the stopword list, i can only
leave it be like this.
